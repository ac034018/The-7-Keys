printText("Once, in the beginning of time, there were 8 deities that ruled the cosmos. The 2 main ones represented life and death, while the other 6 represented the magic elements of light, darkness, water, earth, fire , and wind. The 7 deities were busy on one planet, earth. “I bless this place with bodies of water” Aqua, the water goddess stated. And with that said, the planet was filled with water. “I bless this place with land, so that plants can thrive” Terra, the earth god claimed. All of a sudden, huge chunks of land appeared. “I bless this place with volcanoes,” Ignis, the fire god spoke. So it was, volcanoes appeared, forming a ring of fire. “I bless this place with a sky, along with wind and weather.” Caelum, the sky goddess cooed. The sky then appeared, with gusts of wind and clouds forming. “I bless this place with light, the sun shall rise over it, forming day.” Lux, goddess of light claimed. With that being said, the sun began to rise. “I bless this place darkness, for the sun must rest for some time, the moon will rise, forming night, and it will change every time, along with the stars.” Obscuro, the dark god said. Then the moon and stars rose. Now, Lux and Obscuro worked together to keep the sky the way it was. Then it was Vita, the Goddess of life’s turn. “I bless this place with animals, of all kinds, to live and survive.” Vita then spread her arms, putting her hands on the earth, and so many life forms sprung from out of nowhere. Mortem, the god of death, seeing that he was forgotten, he grew furious. As the living beings grew to spread around the earth, the most intelligent ones were humanlike, which included humans, elves, and other humanoid creatures. As the first ones began to find out the deities created them, they thanked them, but Mortem put a gift. “I bless this place with death of all kinds, there must be an equal balance.” The rest of the deities said nothing, for they knew his wrath was worse than ignis’s. As time passed, the mortals started to prefer the other deities than Mortem, since they knew that he was dangerous, and was the cause of all kinds of death. Knowing this, Mortem’s anger grew rapidly.He then found out that the mortals created civilizations, and he decided to cast a curse on them, which first affected one. With all the negative feelings Mortem had within him, he created a monster, the scariest and most deadliest of the creatures Vita created. He named it Umbra, the shadow of fury, and released it into the world. Umbra fed on the negative thoughts, growing stronger and powerful. In where he landed, there were so many negative thoughts, he grew powerful in no time. The people, seeing that this monster threatened to take over everything, prayed to the gods for their help. The deities realized that they had to do something to take it down. Vita realized Mortem created it, and she knew what to do. Summoning people of all kinds, Vita wanted the 6 elemental deities to bless the chosen people with magic of their element, in order to stop Mortem and Umbra. As the people were blessed with magic, they were released to learn and teach other people, for now everyone had the seed of  magic, a certain element chosen based on their personality. Mortem, hearing this, did the same thing, but with the wickedest and malicious people, and cursed them his magic of destruction. The Gods then united in a meeting (All but Mortem), and knew something had to be done. So they created a temple to seal Umbra, using 7 keys created from their own magic, and the 7 padlocks. All they needed was someone worthy to do it, someone who was brave and kind. The chosen one was named Sirius, a wizard who mastered the magic of Light. Sirius faced Umbra, and managed to seal Umbra within the temple, but Umbra muttered something “Someday, in a thousand years, I will return, and this world I shall conquer, for Mortem’s sake!” With that, he was sealed. A thousand years later, You, a descendant of Sirius, learned about the resurgence of Umbra, and only you can stop him, Mortem and his evil army!")
